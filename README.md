# Enhancing Math Reasoning in Large Language Models with Computation Logic Graphs

Thank you for your attention! Below are the dataset and code. We have fine-tuned a large language model using **Llama-factory**.   https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory


We have released the dataset annotated by machine, while the rest, which has been manually annotated, is currently stored on the company's internal network. We are actively working on data desensitization, and any updates will be shared promptly.  

This article is very important to the author. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
